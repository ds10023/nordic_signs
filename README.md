# scandinavia_signs

This visualization showcases the degree of similarities among Scandinavian sign languages by employing a Swadesh list featuring 100 concepts for sign languages (Woodward, 1993) and the [waffle package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/waffle/). A Swadesh list comprises a curated selection of concepts that can be compared across languages to swiftly determine their relatedness. A greater number of shared words for identical concepts implies a closer relationship between the languages. However, a Swadesh list is limited in scope and is less accurate than comparing the entire lexicon of languages. Other versions of the Swadesh list may yield different results. <br />
The waffle plot, which displays one dot per concept, effectively shows whether a concept has a shared word in two languages.<br />
